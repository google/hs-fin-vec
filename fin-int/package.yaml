name: fin-int
version: 0.2.0
category: Data
synopsis: Finite sets of static size
description: |
    This provides a newtype @Fin@ containing an @Int@ with an invariant that
    its value is less than its type-level @Nat@ bound.  It aims to have low
    overhead compared to @Int@s, and is suitable for use as the index type of
    length-indexed vectors.
